This repo contains scripts of performing actions related to Solana. I am using Backpack as my primary wallet.

mint.js contains code relating to creating mint and minting tokens to a given address.
solTransfer.js contains code relating to airdropping SOL in a newly generated account, and transferring a part of the amount to your wallet.
